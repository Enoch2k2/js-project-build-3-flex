### Overview (What do we want to build?)
Restaurant app, where customers can order

### Features
- Meals page - that list all of the meals the restaurant has
- Order buttons - that allows us to select the meal
- checkout - that allows us to process the order (delivery, pickup, curbside)
- potentially mock a user login?
- user could be an admin

### MVP
* Meals (DOMContentLoaded)
* Order button (click event)
* Checkout (click event, submit)

### Stretch Goals
* mocked admin login


### Day 1 Goal
* We are going to add Materialize to our project
* Create a landing page for our Restaurant
* Meals (Potentially, might be day 2) (definitely day 2)


### Day 2 Goal
* We are going to implement navigation for Meals page
* Add mock data to our db.json for meals
* List meals to the meals the page




### Events
Overall: 
I want to click the meals link and list the meals to the page.

3 question rule:
When: On Page Load (aka: DOMContentLoaded) - x

Cause: Click - x

Effect: Change the header to Meal List and list out the meals inside of an unordered list as lis.
